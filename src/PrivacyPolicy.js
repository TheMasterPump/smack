          <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

          <p>This "Privacy Policy" describes the privacy practices of Smack and its affiliates (collectively, "Smack", "our", "us" or "we") in connection with the Smack Sites and Platform (collectively, the "Services"). It also explains the rights and choices available to individuals regarding their information.</p>

          <p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, please do not use the Smack Platform. By accessing or using the Smack Platform, you acknowledge and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

          <p>We may update this Privacy Statement based on evolving laws, regulations, and industry standards, or any changes to the Smack Platform. If we make changes that materially affect your privacy rights, we will take appropriate steps to notify you, depending on the significance of the changes. If you do not agree with the changes to this Privacy Statement, please stop accessing and using the Smack Platform.</p>

          <p>Our site and the Smack platform are not intended for individuals under 18 years of age and we do not knowingly collect personal data from them. If a parent or guardian learns that their child has provided us with information, they should contact us. We will delete such information from our files as soon as possible.</p>

          <h2>Data Controller for Personal Data</h2>
          <p>The term "Personal Data" used in this policy refers to information that can be associated with a specific person and used to identify them. Personal data does not include aggregated or anonymized information such that a specific person can no longer be identified. Any reference to "Personal Data" in this Privacy Policy includes, without limitation, "Personal Data" as defined by the Data Protection Act 2018.</p>

          <p>A controller of personal data processing is a person or organization that controls the collection, retention, processing or use of personal data, including a person or organization that requests another person or organization to collect, retain, process, use, transfer or disclose personal data on their behalf.</p>

          <h2>Types of Personal Data Collected</h2>
          <p>The types of personal data we may collect from you or through third parties will depend on our interactions with you and may include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Financial information such as your wallet addresses;</li>
            <li>Transaction information such as wallet addresses of senders and recipients of digital assets, activities on the Smack platform, your requests and our responses;</li>
            <li>Usage data which may include your IP address, country of origin, browser or operating system features you use, how you use the Smack platform, among other identifiers;</li>
            <li>Other personal data or commercial and/or identifying information that we may, at our sole discretion, deem necessary to comply with various applicable anti-money laundering laws and regulations.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>We may also collect personal data about you from third parties and other sources such as publicly accessible information sources.</p>

          <p>We collect this information when you freely provide it on the Smack platform or when you use it. We may also collect your personal data from third parties or public sources, as indicated above.</p>

          <p>Unless otherwise indicated, all Personal Data we request is mandatory. Failure to provide it may result in inability to access or use the Smack Platform. If the Smack Platform specifies that certain Personal Data is not mandatory, users are free not to provide it without affecting the availability or operation of the Smack Platform. If in doubt about mandatory Personal Data, users can contact us for clarification.</p>

          <h2>Information We Collect Automatically</h2>
          <p>When you visit the Smack Platform, we may automatically collect certain information about your device, including your web browser, IP address and/or domain name, IMEI or other device information, login identifiers, browser type and version, time zone, browser plugin types and versions, operating systems and platforms, location information, as well as certain cookies installed on your device using cookies and similar technologies. Additionally, when you browse the Site, we may collect information about the web pages or services you view, websites or search terms that redirected you to the Site, and information about your interactions with the Site.</p>

          <h2>Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
          <p>We use cookies (small text files, often encrypted, stored on your computer or mobile device) and similar technologies ("Cookies") to provide you with certain features of our Site and facilitate data collection. This section explains how we use cookies to collect information about your use of our Site and how you can control them.</p>

          <h3>How We Use Cookies</h3>
          <p>We use cookies to track your use of the Smack platform by providing statistics. They also serve to provide you with information (including updates) and to authenticate you based on your browsing history and previous visits to the site.</p>

          <p>For the avoidance of doubt, we do not combine or link data or information collected from cookies with third-party data for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes or share data collected about a particular end user or device with a data broker.</p>

          <h2>Data Security</h2>
          <p>The security of your personal data is our priority. We implement a number of administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect the personal data we collect. The security of your information also depends on you. We ask that you do not share your personal information.</p>

          <p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information over the Internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal data transmitted to the Smack platform. Any transmission of personal data is at your own risk.</p>

          <h2>Blockchain Transactions</h2>
          <p>Your use of digital assets may be recorded on a public blockchain, including settlement of your transactions. Public blockchains are distributed ledgers intended to immutably record transactions across vast computer networks. Many blockchains are open to forensic analysis, which may allow re-identification of individuals conducting transactions and reveal personal data, particularly when blockchain data is combined with other data.</p>

          <p>Since blockchains are decentralized or third-party networks that are neither controlled nor operated by us, we are unable to erase, modify or alter personal data on these networks.</p>

          <h2>Personal Data Retention</h2>
          <p>We will retain your personal data for as long as necessary to achieve the purposes for which we collected it, including to satisfy any legal, regulatory, accounting or reporting requirements. We determine the data retention period based on the quantity, nature and sensitivity of the data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use, the purposes for which we process your personal data and the ability to achieve these purposes by other means, as well as applicable legal requirements.</p>

          <h2>Contact</h2>
          <p>If you wish to contact us regarding any questions about your personal data, please contact support and provide (i) sufficient information to identify you and (ii) a description of your request. Any personal data we collect from you to verify your identity in connection with your request will be used solely for verification purposes.</p>
